## Hello there! Nice to see you here

I'm a front-end developer working with React, Redux and more cool stuff! Enjoying working with Typescript (and Javascript as well). Currently improving my skills as back-end developer using Node.js and learning about Docker and Kubernetes! (And sometimes a bit about cybersecurity)

Coffee it not only fuel!! I enjoy brewing coffee with my AeroPress ‚òïÔ∏è. Share me your gear and recipes!

At nights, I like to play CoD: WZ, join me some time!
